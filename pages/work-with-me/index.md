Hi there, I am a Freelance React Developer from Berlin, Germany. With more than a decade of web development expertise, I have ventured into the realm of freelance React development in 2017. Since then I have worked with various companies on their products. I am fluent in German and English and I offer consulting and freelancing for web development in React.js with TypeScript or JavaScript.

While I am highly specialized in frontend development with React, I gained lots of experience over the years as T-shaped developer who is also proficient in backend development with Next.js and Node.js. I shipped my own full-stack products to market (e.g. CloudCamping), wrote various best-selling books about JavaScript and React, and created a popular blog about web development. You can hire me for:

* Product Development as Solo Developer or in a Team
* Consulting and Development
* Team Lead and Mentor
* MVPs & Prototypes
* Interactive Frontend Applications
* Full-Stack Applications
* Tech Stack Migrations
* Code Audits & Reviews
* Workshops & Training

Over the years, I worked with various companies from startups to enterprises in different industries (energy, banking, government, health) from around the globe (EU, US, UK). For example, I collaborated with diverse entities like MakerDAO in blockchain, TRUMPF in high-precision laser technology, and the US government for its energy sector, among other ventures.

Beyond my freelance work, I'm passionate about sharing my knowledge and empowering others in the React community. Through my blog posts, tutorials, and contributions to [open-source projects](https://github.com/rwieruch), I aim to simplify complex concepts and inspire fellow developers to embark on their own React journey.

As the demand for hiring React developers continues to grow, I remain committed to driving innovation and shaping the future of web development. With my skills, dedication, and a relentless pursuit of excellence, I'm determined to leave a lasting impact on the industry, one project at a time.

If your company is keen to work with me, reach out to me. Looking forward to [hearing](mailto:hello@rwieruch.com) from you :-)
